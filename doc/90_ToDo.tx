H: The use of sudo is currently hard coded, but not every one use/has sudo
H: While the Makefile support DESTDIR as usual, is an other install path than
   the default one not possible. That's also bad while hacking on tulizu. Would
   be nice we could use tulizu without the need to install, just after download

H: parseTizuFile() Add checks not to overwrite known data, exitError if so
M: parseTizuFile() Add checks to avoid gaps in (option/color) numbering, fix
   them automaticly?
L: Make Option-Name-Tag and Option-Description-Tag  mandatory, to force a well
   written tizu file
L: Add a command 'gentizu' as opposite to 'make'
L: Add an option tag to remove parts from the line e.g. :tuR2>:foo bar:<tu:
   That means with --opt r2 'foo bar' gets removed from the line or only the
   tags removed in place when no option is given
L: Add an option tag to insert spaces to the line e.g. :tuI<n>+<m>:
   That means with --opt i<n> would <m> spaces added in place or only the tag
   removed in place when no option is given
